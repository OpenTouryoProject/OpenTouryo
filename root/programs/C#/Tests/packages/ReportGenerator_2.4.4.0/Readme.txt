DESCRIPTION

ReportGenerator converts XML reports generated by OpenCover, PartCover, 
Visual Studio or NCover into human readable reports in various formats.

The reports do not only show the coverage quota, but also include the source 
code and visualize which lines have been covered.

ReportGenerator supports merging several reports into one.
It is also possible to pass one XML file containing several reports to
ReportGenerator (e.g. a build log file).

The following output formats are supported by ReportGenerator:

-HTML, HTMLSummary, HTMLChart
-XML, XMLSummary
-Latex, LatexSummary
-TextSummary
-CsvSummary
-PngChart
-Badges
-Custom formats (https://reportgenerator.codeplex.com/documentation)

Compatibility:

OpenCover
PartCover 4.0
PartCover 2.2, 2.3
dotCover
Visual Studio (vstest.console.exe, CodeCoverage.exe)
NCover (tested version 1.5.8, other versions may not work)

Also available as NuGet package:
