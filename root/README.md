# Open Touryo Template Base for Visual Studio 2015
*Open Touryo Template Base* is the *foundation* of the development infrastructure (project template) of the programs using Open Touryo.

Click [here](Readme.ja.md) for Japanese version of this file.

### Running sample application tasks
You can run the sample application bundled with Open Touryo Template Base for Visual Studio 2015 according to the following steps.

##### Install prerequisites
Install Visual Studio 2015 and SQL Server Express beforehand.  
**Note**:  
You can use an arbitrary version of SQL Server.  
And you can use different editions than Express Edition, but it is necessary to revise connection string that is specified in the sample application.
   
##### Set up sample database
Sample application requires *Northwind* database.  
So, download the setup script installer of *Northwind* database from the following Microsoft site and install.

  - Download: NorthWind and pubs Sample Databases for SQL Server 2000 - Microsoft Download Center  
    http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=23654

When completing the installation, *SQL Server 2000 Sample Databases* folder is created in C drive.
When using SQL Server 2012 or later, open *instnwnd.sql* file in an editor and comment out the following code.  
**Note**:  
Because *sp_option* system stored procedure does not exist in SQL Server 2012 or later, this step is required.

```sql
exec sp_dboption 'Northwind','trunc. log on chkpt.','true'
exec sp_dboption 'Northwind','select into/bulkcopy','true'
```

Execute the following command at a command prompt.  
**Note**:  
In the following command, the path of the folder that contains *SQLCMD.EXE* changes according to the version of SQL Server.  
Execute command after confirming the path of folder in your environment. 
```bat
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Tools\Binn\SQLCMD.EXE" -S localhost\SQLExpress -E -i "C:\SQL Server 2000 Sample Databases\instnwnd.sql"
```

##### Deploy Open Touryo Template Base
Copy *root_VS2015* folder to C drive.  
And rename *root_VS2015* folder to *root*.

##### Build program
When using Open Touryo, it is necessary to build programs **by running the batch files using MSBuild only at the first time**.  
**Note**:  
Open Touryo Template Base contains two parts:
- Framework (Base class 1 and base class 2)
- Sample application (Subclass)

It is necessary to copy the *deliverables generated by building*, that is, *dll files* to the default folder of Open Touryo.  
Therefore, it is necessary to run the batch files which execute a series of build processes.

The batch files are stored in the following folder:
- C:\root\programs\C#  
- C:\root\programs\VB

The following figure shows the batch files which should be run.

Legend:
- ○: Need to run always
- △: Depend on the application architecture
- Empty: Not need to run

</div>

Refer to the above table and build programs by running the batch files in numerical order.

- If necessary, revise the environment variable *BUILDFILEPATH* in z_Common.bat according to the build environment.

- The libraries which are used by Open Touryo Template Base for Visual Studio 2015 are downloaded by NuGet. NuGet libraries might not be downloaded normally under proxy environment. So, when using proxy environment, create environment variable *http_proxy* as follows:
    - Open *C:\root\programs\C#\z_Common.bat* and *C:\root\programs\VB\z_Common.bat* in an editor.
    - By default, the code which creates environment variable *http_proxy* is commented.  
    So, uncomment this code by removing '@rem'.
    - Set your proxy information in environment variable *http_proxy*.

- When the following error occurred at build time, install *Windows SDK for Windows 8*. (Refer to [issue of Open Touryo](https://github.com/OpenTouryoProject/OpenTouryoTemplates/issues/48#issuecomment-241349223).)
```
C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets(2863,5): error MSB3086: Task could not find "AL.exe" using the SdkToolsPath "" or the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v8.0A\WinSDK-NetFx40Tools-x86". Make sure the SdkToolsPath is set and the tool exists in the correct processor specific location under the SdkToolsPath and that the Microsoft Windows SDK is installed
```
  
##### Start ASP.NET state service
Open a command prompt as an administrator and execute the following commands.
```bat
   sc config aspnet_state start= auto
   net start aspnet_state
```

##### Change the URL of the web service
The web services in this template base are supposed to run in the following environment.
- During development (During debugging) : IIS Express
- During operation : IIS

The URL of the web service changes according to the above environment as follows:
```txt
In case of using IIS Express:
http://localhost:xxxx/Service.asmx (xxxx: port number)

In case of using IIS:
http://localhost/yyyy/Service.asmx (yyyy: application name in IIS)
```

The URLs of the web service are defined in the configuration file of *communication control function* of Open Touryo.
By default, the URL in the case of using IIS Express is used.
Therefore, when deploying the web services on IIS, it is necessary to perform the following steps.

- Change the value of *FxXMLTMProtocolDefinition* property from *TMProtocolDefinition2.xml* to *TMProtocolDefinition.xml*.
- Modify *baseUrl* property in WinStore_sample.
  - In *.html files
  - In App.xaml files

##### Run the sample application
Open the following file and run.
At the login screen, enter the arbitrary alphanumeric characters. (By default, the password authentication is not executed.)
